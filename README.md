# Uncapacitated-Fixed-Charge-Facility-Location-Problems
In most of the models that we have considered so far, the number of facilities to be located was an input into the model. For example, in the P-median and P-center problems, we try to locate P facilities to minimize the total demand-weighted distance or the maximum demand-weighted distance. Similarly, in the maximum covering location problem,we try to locate a given number of facilities to maximize the number of demands that are within some specified distance of the nearest facility. One notable exception was the set covering location model in which we try to minimize the number of facilities needed to cover all demands within a specified distance. In that case, the number of facilities was determined endogenously. By optimizing an objective function subject to a constraint that we locate a fixed number of facilities, we are implicitly separating operating costs or benefits as captured by the objective function from the construction costs for which the number of facilities is taken as a proxy. Such a separation is often important and necessary in public sector problems in which different agencies or actors bear the costs and receive the benefits or in which the benefits and costs are incommensurable. In the private sector, these problems are less acute. Costs are generally borne and benefits are realized by the same organization. Furthermore, costs and benefits can typically be measured in monetary units.
